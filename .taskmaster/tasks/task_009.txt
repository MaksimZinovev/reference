# Task ID: 9
# Title: Troubleshoot Deployment Issues
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Identify and fix any deployment issues that arise
# Details:
If assets return 404 errors on project sites, double-check _config.yml root configuration and verify that theme uses url_for, css, and js helpers. Re-run npm run build locally to replicate and debug issues. This task addresses common deployment problems. Refer to detailed analysis in .taskmaster/docs/search-issue-analysis.md for specific search functionality issues.

# Test Strategy:
Test local build to replicate any 404 issues. Verify _config.yml settings match deployment type. Confirm all theme assets use proper Hexo helpers. Validate fixes by rebuilding and testing locally before redeploying.
