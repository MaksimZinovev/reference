# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Custom Domain Configuration
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up custom domain support for the deployed site
# Details:
Create a source/CNAME file containing exactly the custom domain (e.g., cheatsheets.zip). Configure _config.yml with url: https://cheatsheets.zip and root: / for custom domain usage. This task is optional but important for production deployments with custom domains.

# Test Strategy:
Verify CNAME file exists in source/ directory with correct domain. Confirm _config.yml has appropriate URL settings for custom domain. Test by building locally and checking generated URLs.
