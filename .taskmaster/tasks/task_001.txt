# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Clean and prepare the repository for Hexo project deployment
# Details:
Ensure the Hexo project is at the repository root. Create a comprehensive .gitignore file that excludes node_modules, .cache, .hexo, public, and db.json directories. Verify that the npm run build command successfully generates the public/ directory locally. This establishes the foundation for all subsequent deployment tasks.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository structure is correct with Hexo project at root. Confirm .gitignore file exists and contains all specified exclusions. Run npm run build locally and verify public/ directory is generated with expected content.
