# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Quality Assurance Workflows
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up additional workflows for code quality and dependency management
# Details:
Keep npm test, lint, and format as separate workflows that run on pull requests. Optionally add a second job that runs npm audit --omit=dev and npm run deps:check on a scheduled basis. This ensures code quality and dependency security are maintained.

# Test Strategy:
Verify separate workflows exist for testing, linting, and formatting on PRs. Confirm workflows execute successfully. For dependency checks, verify scheduled workflow is configured and runs npm audit and deps:check commands.
