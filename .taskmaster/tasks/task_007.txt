# Task ID: 7
# Title: Verify Build Process Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure all build scripts are properly configured for deployment
# Details:
Verify that the build process uses the correct scripts: build:clean, build:css, build:generate, build:gulp. Confirm that Node/Gulp flags are properly configured for memory management. Ensure CI environment with ~7GB RAM is sufficient for the build process.

# Test Strategy:
Run all build scripts locally to verify they execute successfully. Check package.json for defined build scripts. Monitor memory usage during local builds to ensure CI environment will be sufficient.
