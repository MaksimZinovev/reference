# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Research up to date documentation and code snippets related to task 5

**Response:**

To implement an automated deployment workflow for your Hexo project using GitHub Actions, follow these steps:

**1. Set Up the GitHub Actions Workflow**

Create a `.github/workflows/pages.yml` file in your repository with the following configuration:

```yaml
name: Deploy Hexo to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: true

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Cache npm dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build Hexo site
        run: npm run build

      - name: Upload Pages artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./public

  deploy:
    needs: build
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

**2. Configure GitHub Pages Settings**

In your repository's settings:

- Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.
- Set the **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

This configuration ensures that GitHub Pages uses the output from your GitHub Actions workflow for deployment.

**3. Verify the Workflow**

After pushing the `pages.yml` file to your repository, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow on each push to the `main` branch.

- Monitor the workflow's progress in the **Actions** tab of your repository.
- Upon successful completion, your Hexo site will be deployed to GitHub Pages.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Custom Domain**: If you're using a custom domain, ensure that a `CNAME` file is present in your Hexo project's `source/` directory. This file should contain your custom domain name.

- **Node.js Version**: The workflow specifies Node.js version 20. Adjust this version if your project requires a different version.

- **Caching**: The workflow caches npm dependencies to speed up subsequent builds. Ensure that your `package-lock.json` file is up to date to take advantage of this caching mechanism.

By following these steps, you can automate the deployment of your Hexo site to GitHub Pages, streamlining your development and deployment process.
